# Calculator - The Odin Project

Web-based calculator. Overall it is fairly limited, but has keyboard support. 
In most cases it behaves like a standard pocket calculator. You can chain expressions
using either operator buttons or "equals". Pressing "equals" repeatedly will evaluate the last expression with the result as the first operand.
