# Calculator - The Odin Project

Web-based calculator. Overall it is fairly limited, but has keyboard support. 
In many ways it behaves like a standard pocket calculator. You can chain expressions
using either operator buttons or "equals". Pressing "equals" repeatedly will evaluate the last expression with the result as the first operand. Also, you cannot flip the sign before entering a digit, but it is possible if you added a dot after zero.
